        This page will probably pertain to more personal qualities, as a good overview of myself is on the home page.

        Computer science and programming is still my number one passion and has so many applications that I'm interested in: bio-informatics, computational biology, game dev, and web development. It'd be nice to utilize both my medical background and software background.

        I like frogs and salamanders (currently have a salamander named Sal). Catching horned toads (safely and letting them go) is pretty damn fun. 
        At this point, a few medical fosters have made their way through the house as well.

        I like to believe I stay fit, I run pretty frequently and engage in calisthenics/body-weight training. Dancing would be neat to try out.

        For media, I consume really bad movies, block-buster horror movies, decent shows (too numerous to list), and brain-rot youtube videos about drama. 
        Reading was a larger part of my life before, and I've been meaning to get back into it. Occasionally an audio-book will appear in my life. 
        I mostly read philosophical, existentialist, critical theory, and post-modern texts. My favorite authors include Stuart Hall, Karl Marx, Nietzsche, Octavia Butler, and Foucault. I've read excerpts of Gramsci and Althusser.
        My absolute favorite texts are Simulacra and Simulation by Baudrillard, Necropolitics by Achille Mbembe, and the The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin.
        In college, much of my reading was dominated by the books through CC and Lithum at Columbia.
        I'm currently (SLOWLY) reading Golden Gulags and would like to explore more modern texts regarding colonialism, imperialism, and critical theory.
